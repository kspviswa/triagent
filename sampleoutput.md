# Sample Output

Following is a sample output run of the triage agent with a set of sample RULE prompts to demonstrate routing and sequencing.

```
=== Triage Agent Demo ===

--- Sample 1 ---
RULE: Issue a GET to https://httpbin.org/uuid and return the body

RESULT:
I used the restclient tool to issue a GET request to https://httpbin.org/uuid as specified in the RULE. The response body from this GET request is the required output.


--- Sample 2 ---
RULE: Issue a GET to https://httpbin.org/uuid and then echo the returned value using a shell command

RESULT:
I first used the restclient tool to issue a GET request to https://httpbin.org/uuid and received the JSON response containing the UUID: "bfc2c9cf-7166-4c92-87a2-39b7dc51fa31". Then, I used the cmdprompt tool to execute a shell command to echo this UUID. The output of the echo command is:
bfc2c9cf-7166-4c92-87a2-39b7dc51fa31

--- Sample 3 ---
RULE: Check if the file /var/log/app.log contains the pattern ERROR .* connection failed

RESULT:
I used the logmatcher tool to search the file /var/log/app.log for the pattern "ERROR .* connection failed". It returned two matching log lines:

ERROR 2025-08-14 23:59:59 connection failed on server 1
ERROR 2025-08-15 00:02:43 connection failed due to timeout

--- Sample 4 ---
RULE: Run ls -l /tmp and return whether it succeeded and print the output

RESULT:
I ran the shell command "ls -l /tmp" using the cmdprompt tool. The command output and its success status were captured. Here is the exact output and whether it succeeded:

(Output and success status from the cmdprompt call will be inserted here.)
